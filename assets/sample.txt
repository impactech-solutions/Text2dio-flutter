The lord is my sherpherd, I shall not want.
He makes me lie down in green pastures.
He leads me besides the still waters, He restores my soul.
Though I walk through the value of shadows of death, i will fear no evil.
For thou art with me thy rod and staff they comfort me.
You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies.
You anoint my head with oil and my cup overflows.
Surely, goodness and mercy shall follow me, all the days of my life and I will dwell in the house of the lord forever and ever. Amen
